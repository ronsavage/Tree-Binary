Revision history for Perl extension Tree-Binary.

    * Tree::Binary::Search
        [ thanks to Jan Kratochvil for these ]
        - Some error message corrections 
        - new min_key() and max_key() to get the node keys.

0.06 Thurs Nov 18 2004
    - now using Scalar::Util::blessed() instead of 
      the convoluted UNIVERSAL::isa() stuff. 
      - added Scalar::Util as a dependency

0.05 Tues Oct 12 2004
    - fixed issue with the clone method where it
      did not properly fix the parentel relations
        - added tests and docs for this
    - improved clone and cloneShallow with the addition
      of the _cloneNode utility function, we now deep
      clone the nodes
        - added test and docs for this

0.04 Tues Aug 31 2004
    - fixed memory leak in Tree::Binary, this is
      related to a bug found in Tree::Simple. The
      code is similar so I knew the issue would be
      in here too. I also added a DESTROY method
      to Tree::Binary::Search to force cleanup of
      the underlying Tree::Binary object. 
        - added a test to check that the leak is
          fixed. It requires Test::Memory::Cycle 
          to be run (14_Tree_Binary_leak_test.t)
        - added documentation (copied from Tree::Simple)
          relating to the use of the DESTROY method

0.03 Wed Aug 25 2004
    - added test with Theorems idea in the file
      (50_Tree_Binary_Theorem_Proofs_test.t)
    
Tree::Binary -
    - added the 'size' and 'height' methods
        - added tests for these
        - added documentation for these
        
Tree::Binary::Search - 
    - added the 'accept', 'size' and 'height' methods
      which really just delegate to the underlying 
      Tree::Binary object.
        - added tests for these
        - added documentation for these      

0.02 Tues Aug 24 2004
    - beefed up the test suite a lot
    
Tree::Binary -
    - Added the 'mirror' method
        - added tests and documentation for it
    - added exceptions to 'removeLeft' and 'removeRight'  
      so you cannot remove something that is not there    
        - added tests for that          

Tree::Binary::Search -        
    - fixed up some edge cases on the 'delete' method
        - added tests for these
    - added 'isEmpty' method to test if there is a 
      tree there yet
