=head1 NAME

Tree::Binary::VisitorFactory - A factory object for dispensing Visitor objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Tree::Binary::VisitorFactory;

  my $tf = Tree::Binary::VisitorFactory->new();

  my $visitor = $tf->get('InOrderTraversal');

  # Or call it as a class method:

  my $visitor = Tree::Binary::VisitorFactory->getVisitor('PostOrderTraversal');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object is really just a factory for dispensing Tree::Binary::Visitor::* objects. It is not required to use this package in order to use all the Visitors, it is just a somewhat convienient way to avoid having to type thier long class names.

I considered making this a Singleton, but I did not because I thought that some people might not want that. I know that I am very picky about using Singletons, especially in multiprocess environments like mod_perl, so I implemented the smallest instance I knew how to, and made sure all other methods could be called as class methods too.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<new>

Returns an minimal instance of this object, basically just a reference back to the package (literally, see the source if you care).

=item B<get ($visitor_type)>

Attempts to load the C<$visitor_type> and returns an instance of it if successfull. If no C<$visitor_type> is specified an exception is thrown, if C<$visitor_type> fails to load, and exception is thrown.

=item B<getVisitor ($visitor_type)>

This is an alias of C<get>.

=head1 BUGS

None that I am aware of. Of course, if you find a bug, let me know, and I will be sure to fix it.
