Tree::Binary::Search - A Binary Search Tree for perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The program ships as scripts/search.1.pl:

	#!/usr/bin/env perl

	use strict;
	use warnings;

	use Tree::Binary::Search;

	# -----------------------

	my($btree) = Tree::Binary::Search -> new;

	$btree -> useNumericComparison();

	$btree -> insert(5 => 'Five');
	$btree -> insert(2 => 'Two');
	$btree -> insert(1 => 'One');
	$btree -> insert(3 => 'Three');
	$btree -> insert(4 => 'Four');
	$btree -> insert(9 => 'Nine');
	$btree -> insert(8 => 'Eight');
	$btree -> insert(6 => 'Six');
	$btree -> insert(7 => 'Seven');

	# This creates the following tree (showing keys only):
	#
	#     +-------(5)----------+
	#     |                    |
	#  +-(2)-+              +-(9)

		}
	);

	$btree -> exists(7); # Returns a true value (1 actually).

	$btree -> update(7 => 'Seven (updated)');

	$btree -> select(9); # Returns 'Nine'.

	$btree -> min_key(); # Returns 1.

	$btree -> min(); # Returns 'One'.

	$btree -> max_key(); # Return 9.

	$btree -> max(); # Returns 'Nine'.

	$btree -> delete(5);

	# This results in the following tree (showing keys only):

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a binary search tree, which is a specialized usage of a binary tree. The basic principle is that all elements to the left are less than the root, all elements to the right are greater than the root. This reduces the search time for elements in the tree, by halving the number of nodes that need to be searched each time a node is examined.

Binary search trees are a very well understood data-structure and there is a wealth of information on the web about them.

Trees are a naturally recursive data-structure, and therefore, tend to lend themselves well to recursive traversal functions. I however, have chosen to implement the tree traversal in this module without using recursive subroutines. This is partially a performance descision, even though perl can handle theoreticaly unlimited recursion, subroutine calls to have some overhead. My algorithm is still recursive, I have just chosen to keep it within a single subroutine.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<new>

The constructor will take an optional argument (C<$root>) which a class (or a class name) which is derived from Tree::Binary::Search::Node. It will then use that class to create all its new nodes.

=back

=head2 Accessors

=over 4

=item B<getTree>

This will return the underlying binary tree object. It is a Tree::Binary::Search::Node hierarchy, but can be something else if you use the optional C<$root> argument in the constructor.

=back

=head2 Informational

=over 4

=item B<isEmpty>

Returns true (C<1>) if the tree is empty, and false (C<0>) otherwise.

=item B<size>

Return the number of nodes in the tree.

=item B<height>

Return the length of the longest path from the root to the furthest leaf node.

=back

=head2 Tree Methods

=over 4

=item B<accept ($visitor)>

This will pass the C<$visitor> object to the underlying Tree::Binary::Search::Node C<accept> method.

=item B<DESTROY>

This will clean up the underlying Tree::Binary object by calling DESTROY on its root node. This is necessary to properly clean up circular references. See the documentation for L<Tree::Binary>, specifically the "CIRCULAR REFERENCES" section for more details.

=back

=head2 Comparison Functions

=over 4

=item B<useNumericComparison>

A comparison function needs to be set for a Tree::Binary::Search object to work. This implementes numeric key comparisons.

=item B<useStringComparison>

A comparison function needs to be set for a Tree::Binary::Search object to work. This implementes string key comparisons.

=item B<setComparisonFunction ($CODE)>

A comparison function needs to be set for a Tree::Binary::Search object to work. You can set your own here. The comparison function must return one of three values; -1 for less than, 0 for equal to, and 1 for greater than. The constants EQUAL_TO, GREATER_THAN and LESS_THAN are implemented in the Tree::Binary::Search package to help this.

=back

=head2 Search Methods

=over 4

=item B<insert ($key, $value)>

Inserts the C<$value> at the location for C<$key> in the tree. An exception will be thrown if either C<$key> or C<$value> is undefined. Upon insertion of the first element, we check to be sure a comparison function has been assigned. If one has not been assigned, an exception will be thrown.

=item B<update ($key, $value)>

Updates the C<$value> at the location for C<$key> in the tree. If the key is not found, and exception will be thrown. An exception will also be thrown if either C<$key> or C<$value> is undefined, or if no keys have been inserted yet.

=item B<exists ($key)>

Returns true (C<1>) if the C<$key> specified is found, returns false (C<0>) othewise. An exception will be thrown if C<$key> is undefined, and it will return false (C<0>) if no keys have been inserted yet.

=item B<select ($key)>

Finds and returns the C<$key> specified. If the key is not found, and exception will be thrown. An exception will also be thrown if C<$key> is undefined, or if no keys have yet been inserted.

=item B<delete ($key)>

Deletes the node at C<$key> in the tree, and restructures the tree appropriately. If the key is not found, and exception will be thrown. An exception will also be thrown if C<$key>  is undefined, or if no keys have been inserted yet.

Deletion in binary search trees is difficult, but as with most things about binary search trees, it has been well studied. After a few attempts on my own, I decided it was best to look for a real implementation and use that as my basis. I found C code for the GNU libavl (L<http://www.msu.edu/~pfaffben/avl/libavl.html/Deleting-from-a-BST.html>) online along with an excellent description of the code, so I pretty much copied this implementation directly from the code in this library.

=item B<max_key>

Returns the maximum key stored in the tree (basically the right most node).

=item B<max>

Returns the maximum value stored in the tree (basically the right most node).

=item B<min_key>

Returns the minimum key stored in the tree (basically the left most node).

=item B<min>

Returns the minimum value stored in the tree (basically the left most node).

=head1 OTHER TREE MODULES

There are a number of advanced binary search tree-ish modules on CPAN, they are listed below for your reference. Tree::Binary::Search is not a balanced tree, which may not fit your needs, most of the trees below are balanced in one way or another.

=over 4

=item B<Tree::RedBlack>

This is an implementation of a red-black tree which is a type of balanced binary tree (to the best of my knowledge that is, I am sure I am simplifying it). Tree::Binary::Search does not attempt to balance the tree, so if you are looking for a balanced tree, you might try this.

=item B<Tree::BPTree>

This module implements a B+ tree, rather than a binary search tree. In the authors own words, "B+ trees are balanced trees which provide an ordered map from keys to values. They are useful for indexing large bodies of data. They are similar to 2-3-4 Trees and Red-Black Trees. This implementation supports B+ trees using an arbitrary n value." I am not quite sure exactly how a B+ Tree works, but I am intrigued but this module. It seems to me to be well tested module as well. If you are looking for a B+ Tree, I suggest giving it a look.

=item B<Tree::M>

In its own words, this module "implement M-trees for efficient 'metric/multimedia-searches". From what I can tell, this module is not a b-tree (binary search tree), but an m-tree, which is a tree optimized to handle multi-dimensional (spatial) data, such as latitude and longitude. It is a wrapper around a C++ library.

=item B<Tree::FP>

In the authors own words, "Tree:FP is a Perl implmentation of the FP-Tree based association rule mining algorithm (association rules == market basket analysis)". For a detailed explanation, see "Mining Frequent Patterns without Candidate Generation" by Jiawei Han, Jian Pei, and Yiwen Yin, 2000. Contrarywise, most books on data mining will have information on this algorithm. " While it sounds like a very cool thing, it is not a binary search tree".
=item B<Tree::Ternary>

This is a ternary search trees, as opposed to a binary search tree. Similar, but different. If two nodes are not enough for you, I suggest taking a look at this. These is also an XS based implementation B<Tree::Ternary_XS>.

=item B<Tree>

This is actually the only module I found on CPAN which seems to implement a Binary Search Tree. However, this module was uploaded in October 1999 and as far as I can tell, it has ever been updated (the file modification dates are 05-Jan-1999). There is no actual file called Tree.pm, so CPAN can find no version number. It has no MANIFEST, README of Makefile.PL, so installation is entirely manual. Its documentation is scarce at best, some of it even appears to have been written by Mark Jason Dominus, as far back as 1997 (possibly the source code from an old TPJ article on B-Trees by him).
