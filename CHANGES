	- Ron Savage is now co-maint.
	- Warning for users of the Tree module, which also used to have a module called Tree::Binary:

		and the Tree /distro/ V 1.04 contains Tree::Binary2.
	- Incorporate patch kindly supplied by Karl Kastner 2009-04-05 as RT#44801.
	- Add t/15_Tree_Binary_delete_test.t, which is one of the test programs supplied by Karl.

	- Reformat the dates in this file.
	- Re-work Makefile.PL.
	- Add Build.PL.
	- Add META.json and META.yml.

	- Tree::Binary::Search
		[ thanks to Jan Kratochvil for these ]
	- Some error message corrections
	- new min_key() and max_key() to get the node keys.

0.06  Thu Nov 18 12:00:00 2004
	- now using Scalar::Util::blessed() instead of  the convoluted UNIVERSAL::isa() stuff.
	- added Scalar::Util as a dependency

0.05  Tue Oct 12 12:00:00 2004
	- fixed issue with the clone method where it
		did not properly fix the parentel relations
	- added tests and docs for this
	- improved clone and cloneShallow with the addition
		of the _cloneNode utility function, we now deep
		clone the nodes
	- added test and docs for this

0.04  Tue Aug 31 12:00:00 2004
	- fixed memory leak in Tree::Binary, this is
		related to a bug found in Tree::Simple. The
		code is similar so I knew the issue would be
		in here too. I also added a DESTROY method
		to Tree::Binary::Search to force cleanup of
		the underlying Tree::Binary object.
	- added a test to check that the leak is
		fixed. It requires Test::Memory::Cycle
		to be run (14_Tree_Binary_leak_test.t)
	- added documentation (copied from Tree::Simple)
		relating to the use of the DESTROY method

0.03  Wed Aug 25 12:00:00 2004
	- added test with Theorems idea in the file
		(50_Tree_Binary_Theorem_Proofs_test.t)
	- Tree::Binary
	- added the 'size' and 'height' methods
	- added tests for these
	- added documentation for these
	- Tree::Binary::Search -
	- added the 'accept', 'size' and 'height' methods
		which really just delegate to the underlying
		Tree::Binary object.
	- added tests for these
	- added documentation for these

0.02  Tue Aug 24 12:00:00 2004
    - beefed up the test suite a lot
	- Tree::Binary
	- Added the 'mirror' method
	- added tests and documentation for it
	- added exceptions to 'removeLeft' and 'removeRight'
		so you cannot remove something that is not there
	- added tests for that
	- Tree::Binary::Search
	- fixed up some edge cases on the 'delete' method
	- added tests for these
	- added 'isEmpty' method to test if there is a
	tree there yet
